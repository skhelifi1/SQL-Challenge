# SQL-Challenge
This challenge is my first SQL mini project where i performed Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

### Data Engineering also called "Data Modeling":

* I sketched an ERD based the CSV files available.
* Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files and imported the Data in them.

### Data Analysis

* Ran about 8 queries on the database.
